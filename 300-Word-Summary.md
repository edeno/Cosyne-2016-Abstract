**Summary**: Functional network analysis is a growing area of neuroscience research, but as technology improves and recordings include more sensors and data, the dimensionality of the networks can make analysis unwieldy and hard to interpret. Dimensionality is particularly problematic with increasing network size, because the number of possible connections in a network scales quadratically with the number of sensors (e.g. electrodes). Further, we expect neural processes to form dynamic networks that vary over time, frequency, and spatial scales (eg. within and between brain region), adding complexity to network analyses. While careful statistical modeling and strong hypotheses are important for reducing dimensionality, interactive visualizations are a  neglected tool for coping with high-dimensional analyses.

Visualizations allow us to make multiple simultaneous comparisons, easing the cognitive burden on working memory by efficiently encoding properties of the data into features salient to the visual system. Adding interactivity allows the user to change perspectives and modify analyses on demand, facilitating comprehension and hypothesis generation.

Here we present an interactive web-based visualization application, SpectraVis, that: (1) displays task-related functional networks over time and frequency, (2) compares individual and associative measures on sensor pairs (e.g. spectra, coherences), (3) compares different measures of association (e.g. correlation vs. coherence, binary vs. weighted networks), and (4) views networks at two spatial scales (sensor- and region-of-interest-level). The different modules of SpectraVis are dynamically linked, highlighting relationships between the metrics in response to user interaction. We demonstrate its capabilities on an electrocorticography dataset collected during an overt reading task. We believe this application will be of interest to the COSYNE audience because network analysis is prevalent in systems neuroscience research, visualization is an essential tool for understanding networks at all stages of analysis and current visualization practices do not reflect their richness and complexity. Additionally, SpectraVis is open-source and free to use by the community.
