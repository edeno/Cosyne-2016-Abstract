**Summary**: Analysis of task-driven neural networks in the brain is becoming increasingly common, but as technology improves and we are able to simultaneously record from more electrodes, the dimensionality of the analysis becomes large. Neural signals can vary over time, frequency, within and between brain regions. This is particularly problematic when we consider associations between neural signals, which scale quadratically with the number of electrodes. While statistical techniques and strong hypothesis are important for reducing dimensionality and understanding these networks, an often neglected aspect for understanding these networks is visualization.
