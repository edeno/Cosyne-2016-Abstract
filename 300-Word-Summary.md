**Summary**: Analysis of task-driven functional networks in the brain is becoming common, but as technology improves and we are able to simultaneously record from more sensors, the dimensionality of the networks can make analysis unwieldy and hard to interpret. This is particularly problematic with networks, which scale quadratically with the number of sensors and can vary over time, frequency, within and between brain regions. While statistical techniques and strong hypothesis are important for reducing dimensionality and increasing interpretability, another often neglected tool is visualization.  Visualizations allow us to quickly make multiple, simultaneous comparisons and to ease the cognitive burden on our working memory by efficiently encoding properties of the data into features salient to the human visual perceptual system. Visualizations can be enhanced by adding interactivity --- which allow the user to make comparisons on demand.
